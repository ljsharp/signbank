The documentation is written using reStructuredText [1], and the Sphinx [2]
documentation system. The files have the .rst extension, but they are text
files that can be viewed with any text editor.

To build HTML docs:

* Install Sphinx ``pip install Sphinx``

* In the docs/ directory, run ``make html`` (``make.bat html`` on windows)

This command builds HTML docs to be viewable in _build/html/index.html
